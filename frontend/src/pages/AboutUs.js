            <h2>Our Colourful Story</h2>
            <p>
              Imagine this: There I was, on holiday, surrounded by breathtaking views and inspired to capture the moment. So, I picked up a paintbrush, ready to create my masterpiece... and quickly discovered that my enthusiasm far exceeded my artistic skills. My attempt was, let's say, abstract at best and comically terrible at worst.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's when the lightbulb moment happened! Why should the joy of painting be limited to the naturally gifted? And just like that, Paint by Numbers was born out of a spectacularly failed painting attempt on a sunny beachside afternoon.
